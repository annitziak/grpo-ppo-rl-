# PPO and GRPO Agents

This is a personal and experimental (for fun ðŸ˜Š)repository implements Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an agent on CartPole-v1 using PyTorch and Gymnasium. 

ðŸ“ŠTraining Insights

The mean reward plot shows rapid learning, reaching near-optimal performance (500 reward) within ~100 episodes.
The confidence interval plot (below) highlights the reward variance across the 5 training runs of 200 episodes.
